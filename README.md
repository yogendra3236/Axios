# Axios

SARAL is the eLearning platform of NavGurukul, which is available on website http://saral.navgurukul.org. I have created a CLI based app where users can access the content of saral using the terminal.

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequests and node's http interface.

## Requirements and Installation

If you're using Windows, go through the official site of Nodejs to install it. For Linux-based OS, proceed with the following commands on your terminal.

```
sudo apt-get install npm
npm install axios --save
```
You do also need to install `fs` (File System) to access physical file system, like reading and writing files. To install run the given commands in your terminal.
```
npm install fs --save
```
To run your code, first open your server port using `node file_name.js` in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations.
